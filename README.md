##  Remarks

The auto-play is based on keyboard record of my best(perhaps) play, I have tried my best to make sure this record could fit different timing conditions.

Although, you can provide me a **better** record! Please use `listener` in release and publish it in issues. I'll update in time.

You just need to launch `listner.exe`, switch back to game and play the musical. Once finished, press `ESC` to let listner export a log.

This log will contain all of your keyboard input from when you launch listener to the time you press `ESC`, so please ensure less other useless input during this moment.
